When Odin realized Thor needed to learn humility, he erased Thor's memories and sent him to Earth as a medical student Donald Blake. After learning his lesson, he recovered his powers and memories, and served both Asgard and Earth as Thor. After Thor (and a number of variants) defeated Malekith in the War of the Realms, he became the new All-Father of Asgard. Ruling over his people does not suit the thunder god, well as he prefers to be an active hero instead.",
                "personality": "Thor can be grim when faced with his responsibilities, but he feels most himself when given something he can strike with his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir—preferably a worthy foe. There is little he enjoys more than a drink after a well-fought battle. Despite all his time on Earth—and in America—he still speaks with an Asgardian accent and often in an old-fashioned way."
