After surviving the battle with the Inheritors, she took on the name Ghost-Spider. Her identity has become public in her universe, but she enjoys anonymity she often finds in other worlds.\nAt one point, Stacy lost her spider-powers, but she regained them after bonding with a sentient costume made of synthetic spiders.

He exploited them for profit until he let a robber get away who later shot and killed his Uncle Ben in a botched burglary, driving home the lesson \"with great power there must also come great responsibility.\" Since then, Parker has dedicated himself to fighting crime and helping those who have less power than him.\n\nOver the years, Parker has been cloned, discovered one of his costumes was an alien symbiote and learned more about his deep connection to the Spider-Totem. At the same time, he's battled against the most colorful rogues' gallery around. Meanwhile, he's met up with several different variations of Spider-Man hailing from alternate dimensions, including the younger Miles Morales, also known as Spider-Man.",
                "personality": "Parker is a genius who often lets his sense of responsibility get in the way of taking care of the basics of his life. He's known for his sharp wit and his wisecracking ways, which he often uses to enrage his foes. Despite the problems that often plague his personal life, it's rare that he lets feeling sorry for himself stop him from helping others, especially when he's in costume, webswinging through the city's streets."

As a young adult, he worked as a NASA mechanic, but after being fired, he stole a Kree spaceship and escaped to the stars. The space pirates known as the Ravagers found him stranded in space, and their leader, Yondu, allowed him to join their crew. He eventually turned against them and set out on his own, calling himself Star-Lord.\nQuill learned of his father's identity but refused to join him and rule Spartax. Instead, he helped defeat the massive galactic threats mounted by both  Annihilus and then Ultron, after which he formed a group of adventurers known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Quill recently gained the title Master of the Sun (along with some new powers) and spent over a hundred years adventuring in another dimension before returning to his home reality.\nIn addition to his powers, Quill carries the Element Gun (which allows him to fire different elements), and he wears a space helmet that protects him in outer space, provides him with air to breathe, and allows him to remotely pilot a linked starship.",
                "personality": "Quill is a natural leader who exudes confidence, even when it's unjustified. He thinks of himself as a principled thief, an outlaw with standards. Despite his disdain for rulers, when he found himself elected as the first president of Spartax, he rose to the occasion—until he was ousted and became an outlaw again.\nQuill is often wracked with guilt over the mistakes he's made, some of which have cost hundreds of thousands of lives, but he does his best to cover those with his bravado and his natural charm. Time has helped heal those wounds."

                "history": "Born in Canada in the late 1800s, James Howlett wandered the world under the name Logan. At one point, the Weapon X program captured him and bonded adamantium metal to his entire skeleton, including his retractable claws; his mutant healing factor enabled him to survive the experience. He escaped, but with large gaps in his memory.\nLogan later joined the X-Men and became a valued member of various X-teams. Over time, he recovered most of his memories. He was killed in recent years, but returned to life in time to help establish a new mutant nation on the island of Krakoa.",
                "personality": "Logan can be cold-blooded and slow to trust others, but the restoration of his memory blunted those edges. He's still a no-nonsense man, but that's tempered with the wisdom age brings. After living as a loner for so long, he treasures his found family."

But sometimes, Hydra will spend the resources upgrading an agent to be their tank on the battlefield. Hydra reverse-engineers the technology of heroes and villains, like Iron Man, War Machine, Iron Monger, Titanium Man and others, to create their own specialized armor. While this new armor may not be as dependable as those superbeings, it can still create a shock troop who can carry out the heaviest Hydra missions.",

The latest incarnation sprang from the ruins of World War II-era Germany and Japan, and various factions of it have wavered back and forth between organized crime and fascist power.\nHydra recruits agents all around the world. In public, they know each other by secret signals and whispers of “Hail Hydra.” In secret, they don their green-and-yellow uniforms and chant the Hydra oath: “Hail, Hydra! Immortal Hydra! We shall never be destroyed! Cut off one head, two more shall take its place! We serve none but the Master—as the world shall soon serve us! Hail Hydra!”",
                "personality": "Agents join Hydra for a number of reasons that usually boil down to money and power. They believe that Hydra can take over any organization or government, and they want to be on the winning side, no matter what they have to do to manage it. The Hydra uniform makes them mostly anonymous, fitting well with their oath to replace one fallen agent with two more just like them."

After all, there never seems to be a lack of disaffected people looking to join up with the fascist organization to do their part for world domination. As the Hydra oath goes, “Cut off a limb and two more shall take its place!”\nThose agents who survive long enough—or are ambitious enough—find themselves promoted to positions of leadership within their hierarchical organization. Often they’re the leaders of independent cells sequestered from the rest of Hydra for operational security, and the fact that they’ve survived to that point means (at least to them) that they must be doing something right.",
                "personality": "While Hydra agents like to follow orders, Hydra officers have developed a taste for giving them. They like to shout at their underlings and boss them around, and many of them harbor aspirations of one day becoming the Supreme Hydra themselves. They tend to be mean and merciless—to outsiders, to their subordinates and most especially to those they see as rivals. Many of them see the fact that they’ve risen in the ranks as the proof of their superiority, and because of this, they tend to be cocky as well."
