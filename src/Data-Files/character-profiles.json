At the same time, he's battled against the most colorful rogues' gallery around. Meanwhile, he's met up with several different variations of Spider-Man hailing from alternate dimensions, including the younger Miles Morales, also known as Spider-Man.",

He's known for his sharp wit and his wisecracking ways, which he often uses to enrage his foes. Despite the problems that often plague his personal life, it's rare that he lets feeling sorry for himself stop him from helping others, especially when he's in costume, webswinging through the city's streets."

He's temporarily morphed into other forms since, but he always seems to return to the bushy blue Beast he's best known as.\n\nHank is widely regarded as one of the world's greatest scientists and super heroes.
